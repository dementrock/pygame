This file is an attempt to keep some kind of track of what has been changed
and why to make pygame reality on PyS60.


== Changes for extension modules ==

The extension module names have been renamed. On PC the native extensions 
can be put under pygame directory, but on Symbian this is not possible. 
All native extensions must be placed under sys\bin directory. This is why 
the names were changed to pygame_<extension>. A python wrapper was created 
to simply import all attributes of the native extension to keep the pygame 
API the same.

The extensions are also built-in to the Python.dll to avoid polluting the 
sys\bin directory with over 10 new dlls.
