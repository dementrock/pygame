 - Added SDL_ttf support

SDL-ctypes 0.03
---------------
 - Set func_name instead of __name__ in `SDL.dll.function`; this should
   fix an error about __name__ being unwriteable in OS X (untested).
 - Provide access to unpythonified functions via _SDL_PeepEvents etc,
   rather  than SDL.dll._dll.SDL_PeepEvents.  This is cleaner, and sets
   things up for a unified compatibility mechanism.
 - `since` argument added to `SDL.dll.function` to specify minimum version
   of loaded library.
 - support/prep_doc.py now ignores private functions marked with "_"
 - version support for 1.2.1 to 1.2.10
        since 1.2.7:
            SDL_RWFromConstMem added
        since 1.2.10:
            SDL_WM_SetCaption unicode arguments
            SDL_VideoInfo window size attributes
            SDL_GetKeyRepeat added
 - SDL.array module added
 - SDL.video functions modified to accept and return SDL.array.SDL_array,
   numpy arrays or any other sequence.
 - Implemented SDL_CreateRGSurfaceFrom
 - added test programs test/testpalette.py and test/testgamma.py
 - filled holes in test/testvidinfo.py
 - __copy__ and __deepcopy__ methods added to SDL_Colour and SDL_Rect
 - Constants and enums in keysym.py moved into constants.py
 - SDL_keysym.unicode is now a unicode string type, not integer
