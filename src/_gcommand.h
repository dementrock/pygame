/* Documentation: Command Queue Infrastructure
 *  This lower-level infrastructure code is meant to provide greater stability and 
 *  thread safety to the _movie module. Since we cannot manipulate the SDL event queue
 *  we have to use our own hand-rolled solution. It is just a singly linked list, 
 *  with references to the first and last item, allowing us to do a
 *  simple push/pop implementation. The items in the list are structs that have
 *  all the first members of the default Command struct, making it safe to 
 *  cast the pointers from the pseudo-Command structs to a pointer to 
 *  Command struct. Realistically, you can cast any pointer to any other kind of
 *  pointer(as long as they are the same size!), and C will let you. This is dangerous,
 *  and should only be done very, very carefully. This facility is only useful 
 *  when you need a OO approach, like we did here.
 *  
 *  When making new commands, use the FULL_COMMAND macro, and add a line to registerCommands 
 *  in _gmovie.c to add a new type value. This also enables future proofing as any changes to 
 *  the Command struct will be opaque to the user... mostly.
