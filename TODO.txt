CRITICAL:
=========
* PyFile_* and PyString_* API under python 3.x (see pgcompat.h)
* recheck and redesign X11 implementation for pygame.sdlext.scrap
* merge transform/scale asm changes in rev. 1657:1669
* complete physics collision and contacts and merge it back to the branch
* Fix __new__ constructors in physics module (PyXXX_Type.tp_new!)
* make LayeredGroups class independent from sdl surfaces, where possible
* check all BuildValue and ParseTuple calls for the correct value range
* check anything for possible integer/float overflows
* use copy.copy and copy.deepcopy for consistent object copies
* make use of PointFromObject and SizeFromObject where necessary

Things to ADD:
==============
* (re)add tests
* add examples
* reorganise and add camera module

Things to FIX:
==============
* respect surface->clip_rect where necessary!
* sdl.mouse.cursors, NOT pygame2.sdl.cursors or whatever
* sdlext.transform.threshod_* -> clip_rect, surfaces with different sizes
* documentation
* finish html converter for docs
* get rid of os.system() output under msys (2>/dev/null does not seem to work)
* correct argument checks in pyg_scrap* functions
* check for clipboard resource destruction within pygame.sdlext.scrap.
* surfarray problems (naming, 32/24bpp, see mailing list around 2008-10-21/22)
* SDL_gfx has to set the correct errors (SDL_SetError()). Fix that and
  merge it back to the SDL_gfx upstream

Things to WRAP:
===============
* SDL_LoadObject
* SDL_LoadFunction
* SDL_UnloadObject
* SDL_Audio*
* SDL_Thread*
* SDL_gfx image filter functions
