CRITICAL:
=========
* recheck and redesign X11 implementation for pygame.sdlext.scrap
* merge transform/scale asm changes in rev. 1657:1669
* complete physics collision and contacts and merge it back to the branch
* make LayeredGroups class independent from sdl surfaces, where possible
* check all BuildValue and ParseTuple calls for the correct value range
* check anything for possible integer/float overflows
* use copy.copy and copy.deepcopy for consistent object copies
* make use of PointFromObject and SizeFromObject where necessary
* Merge transform smooth scale changes in rev. 1715:1717
* Merge convolve from rev. 1796
* Rewrite and fix up numpysurfarray and numpysndarray

Things to ADD:
==============
* (re)add tests
* add examples
* reorganise and add camera module
* add portmidi wrapper.
* Subsurfaces via surface[x:y,a:b]? Brought up by ctgPi via IRC

Things to FIX:
==============
* check all string/unicode conversions, esp. file I/O with !UTF-8 and !ASCII
* respect surface->clip_rect where necessary!
* sdl.mouse.cursors, NOT pygame2.sdl.cursors or whatever
* sdlext.transform.threshod_* -> clip_rect, surfaces with different sizes
* documentation
* get rid of os.system() output under msys (2>/dev/null does not seem to work)
* correct argument checks in pyg_scrap* functions
* check for clipboard resource destruction within pygame.sdlext.scrap.
* SDL_gfx has to set the correct errors (SDL_SetError()). Fix that and
  merge it back to the SDL_gfx upstream

Things to WRAP:
===============
* SDL_LoadObject
* SDL_LoadFunction
* SDL_UnloadObject
* SDL_Audio*
* SDL_Thread*
* SDL_gfx image filter functions
