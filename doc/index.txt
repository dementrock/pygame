SDL-ctypes
==========

SDL-ctypes is a Python wrapper around SDL_ using ctypes_.  SDL-ctypes is
currently maintained by `Alex Holkner`_ and supported by `Google Summer of
Code 2006`_.

What's it for?
--------------

In its current state most of the core SDL modules have been wrapped,
and is completely usable for applications that wish to access the
SDL library directly.

The eventual aim of this project is to rewrite Pygame_ using this SDL
wrapper.  This would have several benefits over the current Python
extension:

* It would allow Python programmers to extend Pygame and use extra
  features of SDL with far less effort than is currently required.
* The wrapper can be used on any platform that supports ctypes
  and SDL, and requires no compilation or native code.
* Several Python or Python-like implementations such as PyPy and
  Pyrex are emerging which can make use of this library simply
  by implementing ctypes.
